## Getting started
- Fork the repository
- Select an issue to work on. If you are contributing for the first time, issues with the `good-first-issue` might be a great place to get started
- Create a Pull Request after solving the issue

## Working on Issues
- Please don't start workong on an issue unless it is assigned to you. If you want to work on a specific issue that is currently not assigned to anyone, you can simply comment on the issue, and one of the maintainers would assign the issue to you.
- Issues are labeled with various tags, which might help you in finding an issue which is best-suited for you. The labels convey information regarding the difficulty of the issue, the estimated time required to solve the issue, and other relevent information.
- You can find a list of all the tags, and their meaning at the end of this document

## Creating an issue
- Before creating an issue, do make sure that a similar issue doesnot exist already.
- Issues that you create could be related to anything, from a bug in the codebase to the proposal for an entire feature.
- Make sure to add appropriate labels to the issue, so that it would be easier for everyone to get a gist of what the issue is
- By default, a new issue is assigned to the person who created the issue. However, if you are not interested in working on an issue you created, let us know in the comments, and we would assign it to someone else.
- For issues that describe a new frature to be introcuded, please try to elaborate on why the feature might be useful, and how can we go about implementing the feature. If you are unsure, the slack channel might be a great place to discuss.
